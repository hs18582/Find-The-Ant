# FIND THE ANT

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
CREATE A GAME WHERE THE USER HAS TO INTERACT WITH THE INTERFACE AND TRY TO FIND THE ANT USING THE CLUES GIVEN, THE SHORTEST TIME AND/ OR WITH THE LOWEST SCORE

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
basic idea of an Ant behind a grid and the user must click on the boxes and find the ant. Clues with be given through dots that the ants leaves behind at times, the darker it is the more recent it has been to that box
EXTRAS (different levels of difficulty, adding AI/machine learning)
Have weekly meetings or keep supervisor updated on progress
Use JIRA/GITLAB to keep track and break down big tasks into smaller ones (creating weekly goals to complete)

## Tools and management: 
IntelliJ 2021.2.3 (Java FX)

This was used because it is a free software available to students and compatible with JavaFx. Furhtermore I already had previous knowledge on using IntelliJ with java. It is tailored for Java and only Java development, much more stable than Eclipse, supports many popular Java frameworks & libraries, such as Maven which I use for my Project. The support with VCS is much better as well.

## RISKS:
- Planning
Resource availability
Project complexity
Development time
Project management experience

- Technical
Technology experience
Design complexity

## CHARACTERS/TOKENS
- ANT
- PHERMONES
- SCORE COUNTER
- TIMER
- BUTTON GRID

## Collision Detection:
- This is where there will need to be detection of the intersection of two or more objects
within the game
- Ant cannot walk through the wall â€“ objects must remain solid
Collision detection will be needed for when:
- Ant meets a boundary

## Artificial Intelligence:
This has been thought about and may be implemented later on.
The Ant will use AI to be smart and predict what move the user may make and move the other way 

## HARDWARE REQUIRMENTS
- MOUSE
